# Escape Crew - test plan (6 Oct 2026)

Everything below was built today and has only been checked in code (it
compiles, the analyser passes, the floor plans pass 2,000 random fills). Tick
each line in Studio, then once more in the live game. Send a photo and the F9
(Developer Console) lines for anything wrong.

Studio Play cannot teleport, so the Party House builds `Config.STUDIO_MAP`
(now `gummy`) with a random host (or `Config.STUDIO_HOST`). Ask Claude to switch
either: `partyhouse`, `partyhouse_2`, `partyhouse_3`, `gummy`; host `pumpkin`,
`gummy`, `robot`.

## Lobby (Escape Crew place, Rojo port 34873)
- [ ] House model in place, facing the lawn; no glowing boxes in front of it
- [ ] A host face in a window every 18-40 s, lined up with a window (exact: add Parts named PeekSpot on the windows)
- [ ] Daily reward pop-up on the first visit of the day; next day = day 2; a missed day = day 1
- [ ] Cannot walk round the side or back of the house
- [ ] Shopkeeper: glasses, cap, grin; waves
- [ ] Drive-in car: sit, faces the leaderboards
- [ ] Trampoline bounces you; kick ball rolls and comes back; pumpkin giggles; bell rings
- [ ] 5 leaderboards readable
- [ ] Music plays; music button steps 100 / 50 / 25 / Off and is remembered next visit
- [ ] Shop: 6 boosts with pictures, + buys, - sells back, Take / Taking, R$ buttons
- [ ] Characters screen: every character in 3D (drag to turn), locked upgrades, Reset
- [ ] Invite list: players in this Lobby (one tap, pop-up Join for them) and friends online (Roblox invite)
- [ ] Party circle on the lawn: members stand round it; sign shows x / y and status; others can Join party at it
- [ ] Party panel: floor buttons (Ground, Bedrooms, Attic, Bounce Hall; others "coming soon")
- [ ] Live only: Start takes the party to the chosen floor

## Party House place (Rojo port 34872), each floor
- [ ] Picking a character works until the host comes out; then Change is hidden
- [ ] Every imported character looks right; faces smooth, no flickering shadows
- [ ] The corner map draws this floor; N toggles it; Loft / Ground switches on loft floors
- [ ] Locked doors: key found in a search spot (gold key floats up) or Tinker picks it
- [ ] Opened things open: lids, drawers, coats, vases, presents
- [ ] Trick balloons pop with nothing inside; real ones show a colour
- [ ] Hiding spots say Fits 1 / Fits 2 and keep to it
- [ ] Vents: Crawl takes you to the next room; the host cannot follow
- [ ] Clues cost 10 / 20 / 30 points from this game; the points line counts up
- [ ] The host walks faster than you walk, slower than you run
- [ ] Caught: close-up of the host's face (the right way round), then the cage
- [ ] Boosts in the bag: Candy, Second Wind, Extra Clue, Frozen Pop work when tapped
- [ ] Music and the music button
- [ ] Players button: list of everyone with character, state and points; closes with X
- [ ] Lobby button asks first; live it takes you back to the Lobby (Studio says it only works live)

Per floor:
- [ ] Ground: garden exit; Muscle's hole in the Music Room
- [ ] Bedrooms: Gallery loft and ramp (ramp the right way round); stairwell exit
- [ ] Attic: rafters, 3 vents, "Out onto the roof!" exit
- [ ] Bounce Hall: candy colours, ball pit, slide-tower loft, bounce pads, cloud exit

Per host:
- [ ] Pumpkin: winds up and throws a glowing pumpkin with a trail you can dodge; a hit knocks you down 2 s (F9 in Studio: "[host] throwing a pumpkin")
- [ ] Gummy Bear Man: puddles stick you 3 s; never more than 4; never by doors
- [ ] Robot: his room goes dark for 8 s as soon as you are in the same room; his eyes glow red

## Live game (after publishing both places)
- [ ] Lobby -> chosen floor -> results -> Play again / Back to lobby
- [ ] Escaping a floor unlocks the next one (and Bedrooms unlocks Bounce Hall)
- [ ] Robux purchases arrive (try the cheapest)
